Here are some references to the Standard Template Library along with your book.

Containers to know  Pair, List, Stack, Queue, Set, Map, etc....

Algorithms to know  Shuffle, Sort, Find, Min, Max, etc...

Of course, the iterators/pointers work hand in hand with the Algorithms to span the containers.

Your Project 1, Game that you will develop will utilize this library so you are to become familiar with how to interface and use the STL

http://www.cppstdlib.com/  The other book you were to get for the class.

http://www.josuttis.com/libbook/toc.html  The containers, iterators, algorithms

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-stl-tutorial/  A tutorial for the STL library

http://www.josuttis.com/libbook/algolist.pdf A cheat sheet references the algorithms to the book

Take the tutorial, and create/run as many of netbeans projects with the containers and algorithms I have stated above.
