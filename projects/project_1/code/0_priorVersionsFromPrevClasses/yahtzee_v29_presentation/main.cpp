/* 
 * File:    main.cpp
 * Author:  Danielle F
 * Created: 04-24-23 @7 PM
 * Purpose:  yahtzee_v29_presentation
   
 Note to self: make Scorecard class aggregate Dice class correctly.
 
Comments to User:
 * For ease of use, when you login in as a user or admin I have printed  
   their login info to the screen. Type it in when prompted.  
 * If it's your first time running this code, select 5 from the menu
   that runs in main(). This reset's the code by resetting the User's binary file 
   to 5 records. This way you can start with fresh code that I haven't tested on.
 * Yahtzee default construct will always create an array of players with a minimum
   of 2 players. If player choose 1 player, then the code won't show the 2nd
   player's scorecard.
 * Play() accepts a User object from main() and will only alter their hiScore
   if player 1 wins AND has a higher score then user object's hiScore. 
   Player 1 represents the User object that was passed to play().
   It is essential a shell object that allows User to play without
   alter any of their actual values unless they win.

 v28.2:
 * Deleted findByIndx(). Instead getIndx() returns a valid indx and prints the
   usrArr[indx]
 * Changed findByEmail(). It doesn't read binary file anymore. It loops through
   userArr and compares its email member variable to the string that was passed 
   to its arguments.  
 * isUsrLogin() returns an int. indx or -66 when email is NOT found
 * startGame() passes record's location to Yhatzee, so it can rewrite the record
   inside of it rather than in main().
 * Overloaded printAdUsr(user2.getNumRec(), so it passes numRec
 * Cleaned up adminPortal() by putting each case in its own function
 * Deleted read1bin()
 * Destroyed double ptr in Admin class
 * Updated Admin with survey_v5's Admin class
 
 Admin/User To Do:  
 * Make User::readInputFile() read inputs from file again. isStrEqual() returns false. 
 * Add a bool variable to Admin as a flag for deleted records? 
 * DRY. Clean up repetitive code.
 * Have ~User do something other than cout a message. Program fails without it.
 
Yahtzee To Do: 
 * Destroy double ptr in Yahtzee class
 * Simplify getRules() 
 * After all testing is finished change bonusMin to 63 and MAX_ROUNDS to 13.
  
 Ask Lehr:
 * inBin.read(&binEmail[0]  ...better way?
 * Do we need User in yahtzee private members just because a function is passing it
 * How to aggregate a class when u only thing you want to add functions?
 * Destructors? when there is no dynamic memory to destroy?
