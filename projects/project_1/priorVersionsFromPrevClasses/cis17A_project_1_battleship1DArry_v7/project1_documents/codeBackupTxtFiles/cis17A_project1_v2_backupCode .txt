/* 
 * File:   main.cpp
 * Author: Danielle Fernandez
 * Created: 10-27-2022 @ 6 PM
 * Purpose: CIS 17A Project 1. Covers chapters 9-12 in Tony Gaddis. Battleship v1
 * Version 2: 
 *Added number of players to Score structure.
 *Added player's guess to Player structure.
 *Changed names array to all lowercase so I could utilize toupper()
 *Created a pointer for number of rounds, passed it to a function 
  and added 1 to it each time it was called.
