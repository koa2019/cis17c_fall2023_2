 * Created: 10-26-2022 @ 6 PM
 * Purpose: CIS 17A Project 1. Covers chapters 9-12 in Tony Gaddis. Battleship v1
 * Version 1: 
 *          Changed P1 & P2 strings to pointers.
 *          Created Player structure and set number of wins as a structure member
 *          Added name,total rounds to structure.
 *          Added char[] for choices to randomly fills game board w/a 
 *          ship or blank & writes it to a text file 
 *          Created game banner function that passes a pointer to a structure
