Take my hyperbolic sin/cos recursive function place the angle on a sine or cosine stack
that represents a call to the sine or cosine. When the program returns, examine the
stack for how many times the hyp sine was called and how many times hyp sine/cosine
was called vs. the value you were trying to find. Put the results in a table. Range of
values from -1 to 1 in .1 radian increments. Does the number of function calls agree with
what you predict it should be?

Grading:

From Final - Each problem requires a program and some analysis. Scan the analysis by scanner or by phone. Include the analysis for each problem in a separate folder with the corresponding
computer project.
