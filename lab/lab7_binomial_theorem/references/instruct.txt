With x = Probability of flipping a coin and getting a Head,

and y = Probability of flipping a coin and getting a Tail,

Use the binomial theorem https://medium.com/i-math/the-binomial-theorem-explained-6464f41e5268

to calculate the probability of flipping a coin 4 times and getting 1 tail and 3 heads.

a)  Calculate using the Binomial Theorem.

b)  Simulate by writing some computer code and taking statistics.

      Just loop 10,000 and randomly throw a coin and sum your results to get a percentage.

c)  What if you had a biased coin that would come up heads 60% of the time.

     1)  Calculate the probability using the binomial theorem.

     2)  Simulate the results like in b)

 

In other words simulate tossing 4 coins 10000 times, use a fair coin then a biased coin.

Calculate exactly the results using the binomial theorem.
